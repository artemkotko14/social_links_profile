### Links

- Solution URL: (https://artemkotko14.github.io/social_links_profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this task I was required to build my social links profile.

During this challenge I could practice once again the use of flexbox, hover and focus states and use of custom properties.

The most difficult challenge for me in this project was to make links from buttons to respective pages.
I managed to do that with onclick Event:

```html
<button onclick="location.href='https://github.com/artemkotko14'" type="button">
  GitHub
</button>
```

### Continued development

I would like to work more with focus states to make my pages even more interactive for users.
